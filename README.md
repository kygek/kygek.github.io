## History

**The Kygek Foundation** (also known as **Kygek Foundation**; shortened as **TKF**) is founded on late-2021 as a parent organization of several organizations lead by KygekDev, mainly KygekTeam. We founded TKF to expand our services to not only towards software development areas, but also towards other areas.

## Vision & Mission

> **_Improving lives_**

We realized many people are still struggling even with resources from the Internet. Our investigation revealed that most people are either don't understand how to find the right resources on the Internet or doesn't have curriculums or solid plans in the first place. Therefore, our main goal is to provide people with the right resources to use as well as building solid plans or curriculums for us and people to follow.

> **_Restoring humanity_**

We also realized that the current exponential technological advancements causes many people to become more individualized. Prolonged individualism can cause mental and physical health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and other diseases or disorders. Therefore, our secondary goal is to encourage people to interact with each other, exchange ideas, build projects, as well as improve characther together as a team.
