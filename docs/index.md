After exactly 3 years since KygekDev founded Kygek Development (where its foundation day was declared to be 19 July 2020 when KygekDev released his first PocketMine-MP plugin on Poggit), KygekDev soft-launched The Kygek Foundation in an effort to improve education, wellness, traditions and standards of the society, especially those who are in need. We're preparing this operation to be started in the near future, starting from the Southeast Asia region. Moreover, we're preparing to cooperate with other institutions and organizations to boost our operation to be more effective towards the societly as a whole, and we're planning to start this operation from the IT sector.

The only way to make this operation a huge success is through cooperation, collaboration and collectivism. We would fully respect any of your support towards our organization especially for our team members which are still under planning.

### Vision & Mission

> **_Educating people_**

We realized that education is one of the most fundamental prerequisites for a competitive and modernized society. Unfortunately, a lot of people, and even some institutions, still lacks the education level required to strive in the midst of the demanding requirements of most workplaces. Some have attempted to level up their skills, learn new things and even build a teamwork to catch up with the demands, however sometimes their environment causes their effort to be quite challenging to be maintained due to a lot of reasons. Therefore, our goal is to provide people motivation to learn new things as well as to facilitate their desires on learning things they're passionate at more effectively to be a good contributor to the society as a whole.

> **_Restoring humanity_**

We also realized that the current exponential technological advancements causes many people to become more individualized. Prolonged individualism can cause mental and physical health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and other diseases or disorders. Therefore, our secondary goal is to encourage people to interact with each other, exchange ideas, build projects, as well as improve characther together as a team.

## History

**The Kygek Foundation** (also known as **Kygek Foundation**; shortened as **TKF**) is founded on late 2021 as a parent organization of several organizations lead by KygekDev, mainly KygekTeam. We founded TKF to expand our services to not only towards software development areas, but also towards other areas.

After extensive research, we decided to extend the scope of The Kygek Foundation to be a regional organization. As a part of our mission, we are planning to cooperate with other organizations, institutions, universities, schools and communities, which would hopefully help The Kygek Foundation to become an innovative and cooperative organization to make this world a better place for the people. The Kygek Foundation have been soft-launched on 19 July 2023 by KygekDev and is planned to be officially launched in the near future after it is ready to do so.

## The Future

The future is uncertain; we expect unexpected things happening in the future, so we can't give any solid plans at the moment. However we always hope for the best, whether things looks good or bad.
